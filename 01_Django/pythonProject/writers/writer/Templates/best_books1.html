The Bee Sting
by Paul Murray (Farrar, Straus & Giroux)
Fiction

Paul Murray’s fourth novel is about the eeriness of transformative change.
Its more than six hundred pages employ a rotating structure: the four members of the Barnes family—twelve-year-old PJ, his sister Cass, and his parents Imelda and Dickie—take turns as narrator.
Irony, both caustic and elegiac, flourishes in the knowledge gaps between characters. Again and again, details come back reframed or reanimated by another perspective.
It’s hard to resist Murray in his schoolyard mode, wittily choreographing nerds and bullies.
The chapters featuring Imelda and Dickie are thornier, more treacherous, and formally more ambitious, using stream of consciousness to invoke the shattering power of grief and lust.
Murray is interested in denial and how it ultimately fails to contain our unruly attachments and weird desperation.
The catastrophic price of such denial is evident in the book’s frequent allusions to the climate crisis.
As the book continues, the Earth’s climate and the apocalyptic climate of the Barnes family appear almost to merge, and what began as a coming-of-age saga pulls in stranger and darker forces.
